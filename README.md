# Towards AI-Based Data Analytics for Environmental Monitoring
Angelica Lo Duca, Rosa Lo Duca

## Abstract
Environmental monitoring is essential to intervene promptly in environmental disasters or emergencies. Therefore, in the environmental field, as in other fields, it is essential to create reports quickly. In this article, we describe a possible system that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automatically create environmental reports, always considering the supervision of the environmental expert. The system involves two phases, one for testing and the other for production. During the testing phase, the AI ​​system is calibrated on a subset of the available data, while during the production phase, the AI ​​system is fully operational and works on all the available data. We describe a practical case study using the temperature data provided by ARPA Lazio.
